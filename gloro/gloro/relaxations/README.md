This directory contains additional code implementing the extensions described in our paper [Relaxing Local Robustness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06624.pdf) (appearing in NIPS 2021). If you use code from this directory (e.g., `RtkGloroNet`, `AffinityGloroNet`) please use both of the following citations:
